"""
Analytics Agent stub — Week 2 Walking Skeleton.

Real implementation: Week 7 (aggregates) + Week 8 (Ask the Data).

In the walking skeleton this agent returns the pre-computed batch analytics
fixture (fixture_analytics_refreshed.json) for every record it processes.
The fixture represents aggregate analytics across all 10 demo postings.

Note: in the walking skeleton, the same batch analytics payload is emitted
for every record processed.  In Week 7 the Analytics Agent accumulates data
across all records before emitting a single AnalyticsRefreshed event at
the end of a batch run.

Agent ID (canonical): analytics-agent
Emits:    AnalyticsRefreshed
Consumes: RecordEnriched

Fixture: agents/data/fixtures/fixture_analytics_refreshed.json

Week 7 replaces this stub with:
- Aggregation across 6 dimensions: skill, role, industry, region,
  experience level, company size
- Salary distributions: median, p25, p75, p95 per dimension
- Co-occurrence matrices
- Posting lifecycle metrics
- LLM-generated weekly summaries (deterministic template fallback)
- SQL guardrails: SELECT only, allowed tables, 100-row limit, 30s timeout
