"""
Orchestration Agent stub — Week 2 Walking Skeleton.

Real implementation: Week 6 (LangGraph StateGraph + APScheduler).

In the walking skeleton the Orchestration Agent is the final stage in the
per-record processing loop.  It receives the RenderComplete event, logs it,
and returns an acknowledgment event.

Architecture note: in production, the Orchestration Agent is the SOLE
CONSUMER of all *Failed and *Alert events.  It is not part of the main
data flow — it monitors and retries all other agents.  For Week 2 we
include it as the final sequential step so that all eight agents are
exercised end-to-end and the student sees the full pipeline structure.

Agent ID (canonical): orchestration-agent
Emits:    OrchestrationAck (stub)
Consumes: ALL events (including *Failed / *Alert in production)

Week 6 replaces this stub with:
- LangGraph StateGraph routing
- APScheduler cron scheduling
- Tiered alerting: Warning -> Critical -> Fatal (circuit break + escalation)
- Retry policies per agent (Ingestion: 5 retries exp+jitter, etc.)
- 100% completeness audit log
