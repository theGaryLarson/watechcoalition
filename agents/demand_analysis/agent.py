"""
Demand Analysis Agent stub — Week 2 Walking Skeleton.

THIS AGENT IS PHASE 2 ONLY.

It is included in the walking skeleton so the full eight-agent architecture
is visible and exercised from the beginning, but process() returns None.
The pipeline runner writes a "phase2_skipped" log entry for this agent so
that the run log still contains 80 entries (10 records x 8 agents).

Agent ID (canonical): demand-analysis-agent
Emits:    DemandSignalsUpdated  (Phase 2)
Consumes: RecordEnriched        (Phase 2)

Phase 2 replaces this stub with:
- Demand signal computation: skill velocity, role velocity, regional trends
- Salary forecasting
- Repost-rate analysis
- DemandSignalsUpdated event emission
