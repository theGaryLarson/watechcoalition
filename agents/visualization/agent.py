"""
Visualization Agent stub — Week 2 Walking Skeleton.

Real implementation: Week 5.

In the walking skeleton this agent receives an AnalyticsRefreshed event
and emits a RenderComplete event confirming the dashboard would be updated.
No actual rendering happens in the agent itself; the Streamlit dashboard
reads pipeline_run.json directly for the demo.

Agent ID (canonical): visualization-agent
Emits:    RenderComplete
Consumes: AnalyticsRefreshed

Week 5 replaces this stub with:
- Six Streamlit dashboard pages:
    Ingestion Overview | Normalization Quality | Skill Taxonomy Coverage |
    Weekly Insights | Ask the Data | Operations & Alerts
- PDF, CSV, and JSON exports (standard Phase 1 deliverables)
- TTL cache with staleness banner — never a blank page
- Read-only SQLAlchemy DB connection
