# Computing for All — WaTech Coalition

This repository contains the source code for the **Washington Tech Workforce Coalition** platform: a Next.js and Prisma application that supports employers and job seekers in the tech industry (job listings, employer flows, and jobseeker experience). The stack includes TailwindCSS for styling. A key goal is to add the **Job Intelligence Engine** — an eight-agent Python pipeline to ingest, normalize, enrich, and analyze external job postings — which is planned and scaffolded in `agents/` but not yet implemented.

For a visual overview of the platform architecture (current and planned), see [docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.17.0

- Python >= 3.11 (for the agent pipeline)
- npm
- Docker (for local PostgreSQL)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Building-With-Agents/watechcoalition.git
cd watechcoalition
```

**First-time setup?** Follow the full environment setup guide:

- **[ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md)** — Clone, env config, Docker PostgreSQL, database seed, and run (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Available `npm run` Scripts

- `build`: Builds the application for production.
- `dev`: Runs the application in development mode.
- `prettier`: Formats the code using Prettier.
- `prettier:check`: Checks if the code is formatted according to Prettier.
- `start`: Starts the application in production mode.
- `db:seed:anonymized`: Seeds the database with anonymized JSON fixtures from `prisma/mock-data/` (recommended for local dev).
- `seed`: Seeds the database with synthetic/faker-generated data (does not use `prisma/mock-data/`).
- `lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code issues.

## Agent Pipeline

This project is designed to include a **Job Intelligence Engine** — an eight-agent Python pipeline that will ingest, normalize, enrich, and analyze external job postings (pipeline not yet implemented). The agent layer is scaffolded in `agents/` and will run alongside the Next.js app.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for full architecture details, agent specs, and run instructions.

```bash
cd agents && pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run agents/dashboard/streamlit_app.py
```
